### 1. Database Setup:
- **Start by setting up the database**: Since the SeedInsight project relies heavily on data storage and retrieval, establishing the database schema and setting up the necessary tables is crucial. This includes creating tables for users, seeds, ecological zones, seed companies, and any other relevant entities.
- **Rationale**: By laying the groundwork with a well-defined database structure, you ensure that the application has a solid foundation to build upon. Plus, having the database ready allows you to start implementing backend functionality and integrating it with the frontend components.

### 2. Backend Development:
- **Proceed with backend development**: Once the database is set up, you can begin developing the backend logic and API endpoints. This includes implementing user authentication, seed data management, data analysis algorithms, and any other backend functionalities required to support the dashboard.
- **Rationale**: Developing the backend first allows you to establish the core business logic and data processing mechanisms. It also enables you to create a robust API that the frontend dashboard can interact with to retrieve and manipulate data.

### 3. Frontend Dashboard:
- **Move on to frontend development**: With the backend in place, you can start building the frontend dashboard. This involves designing the user interface, implementing data visualization components, and integrating user interaction features.
- **Rationale**: By tackling the frontend after the backend, you have a clear understanding of the data and functionalities that need to be displayed and accessed on the dashboard. This helps streamline the development process and ensures that the frontend aligns seamlessly with the backend API.

### 4. Iterative Development:
- **Adopt an iterative development approach**: Instead of completing each component in isolation, iterate between backend and frontend development iteratively. This allows for continuous testing, feedback, and refinement throughout the development process.
- **Rationale**: Iterative development promotes flexibility and adaptability, enabling you to address challenges and incorporate feedback incrementally. It also facilitates early detection and resolution of integration issues between backend and frontend components.
